TimeCalc is a very simple utility for calculating times. I use it for calculating splits or predicting race times. It is a calculator that supports doubles and times. For example:

If I run 5 kilometers at 3:30/kilometer, the race will take me 17:30.

    > 5*3:30
    17:30

If I want to know how fast my splits need to be in order to run a 10K in 37:00.

    > 37:00/10
    3:42

If I want to add two times:

    > 3:42 + 3:30 + 3:49
    11:01

Or calculating the splits Bekele needs to run on the marathon:

    > 2:02:13 / 42.195
    2:54

Which is very fast, indeed.
